# Marshmallow Mobile Test

Your task is to create a mobile app that provides a brief overview of SpaceX's rockets and dragons. ðŸ“±ðŸš€ðŸ›°

The task is the same across Android and iOS, so mobile means the platform that you are applying for.

## What we'd like you to do

Build a mobile app with the functionality that meets the following requirements:

- Fetch and render a list of _rockets_ or _dragons_ from SpaceX's API.
- Show extended information about a selected list item in a separate detail screen.

> Question: "How should I position the list items?", "What data should I show in the full item view", "Do I need to bother with UI/UX?"

**Answer:** Completely up to you. However, this is an opportunity to show us what you're capable of and we'd love you to surprise us!

## How long do I have?

You can spend as long as you want on this task.

## Where do I find these rockets and dragons you speak of?

Please refer to [SpaceX's open API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs/v4) for this task. The `/rockets` and `/dragons` endpoints should provide the necessary data.

## What should the UI look like?

What the UI looks like is completely up to you, however we suggest that it contains:

1. A way to switch between rockets and dragons (eg. bottom tabs).
2. A main screen containing the list of items.
3. A single item screen with an extended description (containing an image, name, etc.).

> We have no specific styling requirements, you have **complete** freedom over what the UI looks like

## What should I use to build the app?

Please feel free to use any library of tool that you have experience with:

- for Android, for example you can use Retrofit, RxJava, Coroutines, Dagger
- for iOS, you can use ...

Please note that you **don't** have to know those tools or frameworks, they are just examples! 

Feel free to use the one that you are more confident with.

### Bonus points

It would impress us if you used any of the following technologies and patterns (but it is not required!):

- Dependency injection
- Separation between UI and business logic
-  Theming and localisation
- Tests

## How do I submit my app?

- Send us a link to the source code (in a public Github repository or an online code editor).
- Brief instructions on how to run the app.

> !! No mysterious ZIP files sent over email please!

## How we will evaluate your code
Please note that this exercise isn't about write the perfect application, but rather have a starting point of the rest of the interview.
When we evaluate your code we will consider:

- Code organisation
- Quality
- Readability
- Style
- UI/UX design
- Anything that shows you've gone above and beyond!

Feel free to add a README/TODOs with the next steps that you would have done if you had more time.
